# Quiz-Me

"Quiz me" was built with my latest knowledge of Javascript. I started this application with one simple HTML. Through the processes of building "Quiz me," I added one CSS style sheet, another HTML file, and Two Javascript files. "Quiz me" looks very simple from the outside, but if you stick your head over the hood, you will find a complex javaScript logic file. The questions are built into an array of objects and, I'm displaying the questions through inner.HTML to the main HTML file. The score is calculated by how many questions you got right by the time left on the timer. All of the user information is stored in local storage. Added to each time you play so you can compete against yourself or friends to become the King of Quiz me. Thank you for playing, and i hope you enjoy my Quiz Game.
